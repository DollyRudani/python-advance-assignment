However,What about an expression like 10 +obj which is really (10).add(myobj)? The 10 is an instance of a python build=in type and its add__method doesn't know anything about the new type,obj so it will return a error NotImplemented. To handle such scenarios,__radd__is used.Python will first try (10).__add(myobj), and if that returns NotImplemented,Python will check if the right hand operand implements radd,and if it does ,it will call obj.__radd(10) rather than raising a TypeError."
