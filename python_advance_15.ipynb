    "Assignment Expressions(:=)\n",
    "\n",
    "This operator is used to assign and return a value in the same expression. This removes the need for initializing the variable upfront.\n",

    "f-strings now support “=”\n",
    "\n",
    "This string formatting mechanism is known as Literal String Interpolation or more commonly as F-strings (because of the leading f character preceding the string literal). The idea behind f-strings is to make string interpolation simpler. Python 3.8 allows the use of the above-discussed assignment operator and equal sign (=) inside the f-strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "reversed() works with a dictionary Unlike Python 3.7, now in Python 3.8, the built-in method “reversed()” can be used for accessing the elements in the reverse order of insertion.\n",

    "No parentheses for return and yield statements ‘yield’ and ‘return’ statements do not require parentheses to return multiple values.\n",
