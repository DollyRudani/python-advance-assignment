    "To avoid circular importing and the potential issues it can cause, you can follow these strategies when structuring your program:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Analyze and refactor module dependencies**: Carefully analyze the dependencies between modules in your program. Identify any circular dependencies and consider whether they are necessary or can be eliminated. Look for opportunities to refactor and decouple the code to reduce interdependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Use a third module as an intermediary**: If two modules need to share functionality, consider creating a third module that encapsulates the common functionality. Both modules can then import and use the third module without directly importing each other. This approach helps break the circular dependency.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Split functionality into separate modules**: Evaluate if there is an opportunity to split the functionality into separate modules to reduce interdependencies. By organizing your code into smaller, more focused modules, you can often avoid circular importing scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Use function parameters or method calls**: Instead of directly importing a module, you can pass necessary objects, variables, or references as parameters to functions or methods. This allows modules to interact without directly importing each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Apply lazy imports**: Delay the import of a module until it is needed. Rather than importing modules at the top of your file, import them within functions or methods where they are required. This helps to avoid importing modules that have circular dependencies during the initial module loading.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Reconsider module design and structure**: If circular dependencies persist despite attempts to refactor, it may be necessary to rethink the overall design and structure of your program. Consider adopting design patterns, such as dependency injection or the observer pattern, to decouple modules and reduce interdependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Leverage package-level imports**: If you are working with multiple packages, you can utilize package-level imports, where imports are specified in the `__init__.py` files of the respective packages. This allows you to control the order of imports and can help resolve circular importing issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "By applying these strategies and carefully managing module dependencies, you can minimize the occurrence of circular importing and avoid the associated bugs and hidden dependencies in your program."
